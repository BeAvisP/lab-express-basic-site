      <h2>Who is Sylvanas Windrunner?</h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, also referred to as "the Dark Lady" and "the
          Banshee Queen" during her rule, as well as "the Banshee" following the
          Fourth War, is the former Warchief of the Horde and former supreme
          ruler of the Forsaken, one of the most powerful factions of undead on
          Azeroth. In life, Sylvanas was the ranger-general of Silvermoon, whose
          leadership acumen and martial prowess were without equal. During the
          Third War, she bravely defended Quel'Thalas from a Scourge invasion
          led by the death knight Arthas Menethil. Ultimately, however, Sylvanas
          fell in battle. Rather than honor the ranger-general with a quick
          death, Arthas ripped out her soul and transformed it into a banshee: a
          cunning and vengeful agent of the Lich King empowered by hate. When
          the Lich King's control over his minions weakened, Sylvanas broke away
          from her tyrannical master's control and reclaimed her body. Vowing to
          avenge her death, Sylvanas gathered other renegade undead and set out
          to wage war against the Scourge. Thus it was that the Forsaken came to
          be, with Sylvanas as their queen. Under Sylvanas' command, the
          Forsaken joined the Horde and later helped bring about the Lich King's
          fall in the frozen wastes of Northrend. She seeks a higher purpose for
          a people who have already died once.

          Yet many challenges still lay ahead for Sylvanas. After an uprising
          within her ranks that killed other members of the Horde, the banshee
          queen is now mistrusted by many of her allies. Most recently, Sylvanas
          began fortifying her territory within the Tirisfal Glades in order to
          establish a proper kingdom for her followers. While Sylvanas maintains
          that her loyalty to the Horde is undiminished, some of the faction's
          members are uncertain about her true intentions.

        <p>
          After the fall of the Lich King, Sylvanas came to the shocking
          realization that she, like Arthas before her, was damned to an
          eternity of darkness and torture in the afterlife. Yet she also found
          new purpose when she met the ancient evil controlling this realm, an
          entity known only as the Jailer. She formed an alliance with him, and
          shortly after entered into a pact with the Val'kyr, allowing Sylvanas
          to regain her place in the realm of the living for as long as her
          Val'kyr survive. Sylvanas would initially claim that she considered
          her people a bulwark against the horrifying darkness that awaits her
          in the end. Though the truth of this matter was that she needed them
          to create as much war and death as possible to deliver souls to her
          new ally. To this end, she subsequently launched an aggressive attack
          into the regions of Lordaeron and the greater Eastern Kingdoms not
          directly under her control, in an attempt to conquer the continent and
          secure it for the Forsaken, while securing all souls lost for the
          Jailer.

          After being mortally wounded during the battle for the Broken Shore,
          Warchief Vol'jin declared Sylvanas as his successor with his dying
          breath, leaving her to lead the Horde against the invading forces of
          the Burning Legion. Following the Legion's defeat, Sylvanas led the
          Horde against the Alliance in a war that spanned all of Azeroth.

          After being challenged to mak'gora by defector Varok Saurfang,
          Sylvanas easily defeated him after a short combat with the help of her
          newfound powers, but in the process revealed to the spectators of
          Horde and Alliance that these matters meant nothing to her, implying
          that she was dealing with matters of much grander scale. Ultimately,
          Sylvanas left everyone behind, flew away from Orgrimmar in the form of
          a dark smoke and despite the appearances, there were those who were
          still loyal to her cause.

          Sylvanas serves as one of the main characters in Warcraft III: Reign
          of Chaos, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, and World of Warcraft.
          However, Sylvanas has recently become more antagonistic, serving as
          one of the main antagonists (alongside N'Zoth) in Battle for Azeroth,
          and a major antagonist in Shadowlands.
